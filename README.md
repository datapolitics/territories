Territories
================


This package allows to represent and operate on territories.

The only assumptions of the model are :
- The entire world can be partitioned with atomic entities
- There are several partition of the world in sets of atomic entities.
- A **territory** is a collection of those atomic entities


A Territory object can be any combination of entities, such as municipalities, countries, county, l√§nders, states, etc, as long as it belongs to the DAG of entities. The package guarantee that the representation of a territory will always be efficient. For instance, if I create a `Territory` object with all regions from a country, it will simplify it to only the country object.

## Usage

At startup, you need to initialize a tree of all known entities. Ths can be done in two ways :
- from a local file. By default, the tree is build from a file in the API_CACHE_DIR
- from a database : there are utility functions in territories.database to create a tree from the current database. You need to specify some environements variables to use such functions.


```python
from territories import Territory, MissingTreeCache
from territories.database import create_connection, stream_tu_table

try:
    Territory.load_tree()
except MissingTreeCache:
    with create_connection("crawling") as cnx:
        Territory.build_tree(data_stream=stream_tu_table(cnx))
```

The `build_tree()` function will read the TU table, and create a territory tree out of it, with all its 35099 elements



## Exemple of a potential usage of such a package

```python
# es code are received from the UI, for instance
topic_territory = Territory.from_tu_ids("COM:234", "COM:943", "DEP:23")


# lowest common ancestor of the territorial units
lca = topic_territory.lowest_common_ancestor()

# all ancestors of the territorial units
all_ancestors = topic_territory.ancestors()

# union of the territories
bu_teritory = Territory.union(*(topic.territory for topic in bu))

for article in articles:
    for territory in article.territories:
        if territory in bu_territory:
            article.send() # send article in brief
        if territory in topic_territory:
            # do something else
```


## The pydantic feature


Territories are valid Pydantic types. It means you can validate input data with type hints ; in a web server for instance. Exemples to come.



## How to develop

This package depends on [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). This is a better and simpler package manager than pip, and I strongly encourage you to make the switch.

- run ```uv sync``` to create a virtual env and install all dependencies.
- update the code in **src/territories/**
- add tests in **tests/**
- run the tests with `uv run pytest`
- you can quickly iterate and test with the notebooks in **docs/usage.ipynb** by installing the package in the virtual env with `uv sync`

## Tests

The tests checks the behavior of **Territory** objects. You can change whatever you want internaly as long as the tests passes.
The tests relies on the **full_territorial_tree.gzip** file to load a territorial tree. If you need to update it, please use the `test_build_tree.py` file.



## Deployment

CI automatically deploy the package when there are pushes on the main branch. Do not deploy yourself.
