Territories
================


This package allows to represent and operate on territories.

The only assumptions of the model are :
- the entire world can be partitioned with atomic entities
- a **territory** is a collection of those atomic entities





## Package structure

I used [this](https://py-pkgs.org/01-introduction) website as the main ressource for the structure of the package. Also [this](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/) one is useful.


## Tests

run pytest

## Deployment

CI to come
